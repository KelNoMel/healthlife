                Can I bring my own formulation and packaging?
            </h2>
            <p>
            Yes! You can absolutely bring your own formulation and 
            packaging. We provide a range of services from 
            formulation to filling to packing so our clients can 
            select the services that best fit their needs.
            </p>

            <p>Alternatively, if you don’t have your own formulation or packaging, 
                    we can work with you to <a href="../oem/product-development.html">

            <h2 id="q2">
                Can you help with formulation and packaging?
            </h2>
            <p>

                formulas and packaging for your products. Our product

            <h2 id="q3">
                How long does it take to make a formula?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The cost for each new project is unique and cant be estimated 
                with any accuracy without all information. Our product brief 
                form should be completed so we understand all the variables from 
                ingredients, product profile, packaging types, production volumes 
                and any special requirements you may have.
            </p>
            <p>
                On average we complete formulations within 8-14 weeks depending 
                on the complexity of the project. Once we have reviewed your 
                brief we can provide more specific guidance.
            </p>

            <h2 id="q4">
                How much does it cost to manufacture my products?
            </h2>
            <p>
                The cost varies depending on the selected ingredients, packaging, 
                production volumes and other requirements. Please contact us with 
                your product and service specifications so we can provide you a 
                quote.

            <h2 id="q5">
                Can you make samples?

                Yes! We can make samples of your products for you. We are also capable 
                of doing small runs of product as our smallest drum size is 5kg.

            <h2 id="q6">
                What quality testing do you use?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Quality is of the highest importance at Health Life Pharmaceuticals. 
                We do a variety of testing in-house including, but not limited to, 
                shelf-life studies, microbiological testing, physical and analytical 
                testing, and heavy metals and toxicity testing. We also have the 
                resources to organise external testing if required.
            </p>

            <h2 id="q7">
                What are the manufacturing lead times?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Production is typically completed within 6-8 weeks from receipt of all 
                packaging and raw materials, though this can vary depending on 
                production volume.
            </p>
